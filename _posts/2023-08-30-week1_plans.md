## Week 1:  
 This week we had a task to build our homepage using index.md in VS code. I learned to run and stop a server using the commands “make” and “make stop.” After setting up all my tools and files, I was ready to create my own homepage. To the homepage I added background info about myself and some relevant images including the freeform drawing. I also learned to commit and push all my new files after editing them so that they save to my GitHub account. In addition, I added a 2048 cupcake game to my code and was able to have it running. Despite facing a problem with the arrow keys I was able to switch it so that the "wasd" keys would control the 2048 cupcake game!
