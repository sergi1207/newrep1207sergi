## Week 0: 

 The week started off by installing all necessary extensions for the course as well as creating a GitHub account. We also created s freeform drawing about ourselves, which we had to present to our partner. This week I learned how to use most of my tools and was ready to code in week 1. 

## Main Troubles/Solutions:

This week my main problems were understanding all my tools since I was new to all of it, however with the help of my partner and classmates I was able to understand most of my tools.
