## Questions
### What are the benefits of a team?
There are multiple benefits of working in a team, such as collaboration and help. When we are stuck or have some issues, we consult with eachother on Slack or iMessage. Another key benefit is a good environment, for coding you always need to have a helpful and good environment surrounding you. Lastly, working with a team is fun and can make coding a great time!
### Describe how you will facilitate commuinication amongst group members?
For communication, we only use 2 platforms, iMessage and Slack. We have created group chats and already have communicated and put in code. We also meet up during CSP and work with eachother, but when we are home, we use Slack to communicate about our problems and successes.
### How will you hold each person accountable for their portion of the work.
We all did a good amount of work, and we will let the person speak over their portion of work. The scrum master (Abdullah), will also talk about these questions and benefits. The work has to be at a fair split, but also has to be working, so we all review our work before. Working in a team helps us communicate about our issues, work, and successes!
