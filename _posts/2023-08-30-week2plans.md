## Week 2:
For week 2, my plan was to succesfully create a lab notebook where I could include my plans, hacks, and tangibles. My plan was to add a game and a calculator to my hacks, and a bunch of my issues, and accomplishments to my review tickets after the first two weeks (Week 0 + Week 1). This week I also wanted to add my own table, which I wanted it to be either ebout cars or motorcycles.
