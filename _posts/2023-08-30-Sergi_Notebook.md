## Week 0: 
 The week started off by installing all necessary extensions for the course as well as creating a GitHub account. We also created s freeform drawing about ourselves, which we had to present to our partner. This week I learned how to use most of my tools and was ready to code in week 1.

## Week 1:  
 This week we had a task to build our homepage using index.md in VS code. I learned to run and stop a server using the commands “make” and “make stop.” After setting up all my tools and files, I was ready to create my own homepage. To the homepage I added background info about myself and some relevant images including the freeform drawing. I also learned to commit and push all my new files after editing them so that they save to my GitHub account.

## Week 2:
 This week we had to create our personal Lab Notebook. At first nothing worked, and after a while my partner an I realized that we were missing the date and .md at the end of a copy of a file that we named “Name_Notebook.” We also added a snake game to our page this week. We made a new file in the “posts” section so it would be visible in the “Compsci” section once we ran and saved the game. In addition, this week I experimented with Python and Jupyter notebook, yet wasn’t too successful. This week we also described our previous weeks and what we did in our Lab Notebook section.
