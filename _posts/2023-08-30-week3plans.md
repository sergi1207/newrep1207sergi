## Week 3: 
For this week I am planning to collaborate with my partner to add a new quiz game. In addition, I want to add more information to my files, and maybe add a new game or project to the "hacks" section of my lab notebook. I also want to be able to use all python tools and java tools to the best of my ability. I will attempt to add a random number generator, or improve my calculator and add some color and style to it.
