## Week 4: 
This week, we were assigned to do the agile and review 1.1-1.4/read the team test expectations. Our plan with Abdullah was to find our partners and start working on the team project by assigning roles, rules and other key points. In addition, we would want to make a diagram with all of that information and complete all the collegeboard assignments in order to get ready for the upcoming team test. Our team decided to work on all those things over the weekend. I was gonna do the Inputs/Outputs, abdullah the questions, lincoln the tester function, while Ishan was supposed to do the game with comments. I was also planning to do the editing for the video.
