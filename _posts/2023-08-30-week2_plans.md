## Week 2:
 This week we had to create our personal Lab Notebook. At first nothing worked, and after a while my partner an I realized that we were missing the date and .md at the end of a copy of a file that we named “Name_Notebook.” We also added a snake game to our page this week. We made a new file in the “posts” section so it would be visible in the “Compsci” section once we ran and saved the game. In addition, this week I experimented with Python and Jupyter notebook, yet wasn’t too successful. This week we also described our previous weeks and what we did in our Lab Notebook section.
