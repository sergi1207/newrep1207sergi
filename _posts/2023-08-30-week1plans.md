## Week 1:  
 For week 1 my plan was to make my own index page that didn't look like the one my teacher made. My plan was to add a couple images of me and my family as well as my freeform picture. Then, followed by some background information about me. My plan was to master all my tools and fix the issues that I had such as running the make command, installing python, and changing the commands to play my 2048 cupcake game once I got it working.
