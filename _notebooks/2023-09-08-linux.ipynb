      "- The purpose is to build lessons and distribute across different Computer Science sections (CSSE, CSP, CSA), a pathway that covers 3 years of High School Instruction.\n",
      "- The primary languages and frameworks that are taught are `JavaScript/HTML/CSS`, `Python/Flask`, `Java/Spring`.  Read below for more details.\n",
      "- In this course, Teacher content is not exclusively developed by Teachers.  In fact, many Students have been invited to develop and publish content into this repository.  Their names will appear as authors on the content which they aided in producing.\n",

      "- `Tech Talks`, aka lectures, are intended to be interactive and utilize `Jupyter Notebooks` and Websites.  This is an example of blending instruction and tools together, which in turn provide additional resources for learning.  For instance, deep knowledge on  GitHub Pages and Notebooks are valuable in understanding principles behind Full Stack Development and Data Science. \n",

      "\n",
      "Deployment Cycle.  In the deplopyment cycle, `sync-github-action-review`, it is a requirement to complete the development cycle prior to doing a VSCode `sync`.  The sync triggers github repository update.  The action starts the jekyll build to publish the website.  Any step can have errors and will require you to do a review.\n",
